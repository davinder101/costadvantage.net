                  <b>Saving money is good, investing money is better, and investing money with a plan in place is the best.</b><br/><br/>
                  <b>IMPORTANCE OF PLANING:</b>
                  
              <p>An individual's financial plan should be reviewed to be in sync with his different life stages and the various requirements that are specific to a certain stage in life.</p>
                  
                  <p>Changing circumstances like marriage, purchase of a house, child's education mandate that the financial plan evolves to meet these objectives within the given timeline.</p>
                  
                  <p>A financial plan of an individual should be tailored to meet one's individual needs at different stages of life and it is important to have a balanced mix of instruments ( asset allocation ) to address the various needs of <b>protection, savings and wealth creation</b>.</p>
                  
                  <p>Mutual Funds (Equities) in the long term and debt in the short term. This clearly shows the relation between risk and reward. Longer the time frame helps you take greater risk which is likely to yield higher returns. Short time frame yields less risk and lesser returns. Since some of our goals are short term and some long term we need to have a healthy mix of both safe and risky assets to meet our goals. Asset allocation is the cornerstone of a good Financial Planning.</p>
                  
                  <b>We work as a Consultant identifying your needs (Present, anticipated, Future)  & suggesting unbiased solutions to these needs INSURANCE </b><br/>
                  <b>Why Insurance? </b><br/><br/>
                  
                  <p>Depending on the situation and structure, it is possible that other avenues of investment generate a better return as compared to insurance.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, in the unfortunate event of the demise of the family breadwinner, only life insurance will provide succor to the family of the policyholder. There are many complex calculations as well as simple rules of thumb to estimate the quantum of insurance needed for an individual.</p>
                  
                  <p>A simplistic way is to calculate life insurance as about 20 times of the individual's annual income. Here it is important to remember that life insurance is not meant only to cover the expenses of daily living of the family in the absence of the breadwinner.</p>
                  
                  <p>It should be sufficient to bail out the family when they face large financial exigencies. Empirical evidence shows that internationally, life insurance occupies an integral part of an individual's financial plan and other elements are built around it. The Indian market is witnessing a slow but certain shift of consumer preference towards protection. </p>
                  
                  <b>We Evaluating Your Insurance Portfolio: What Do You Really Need?</b><br/><br/>
                  <p>Today, an individual has an array of options to choose from when s/he starts financial planning. It is observed that people tend to focus on the 'wealth creation' aspect of financial planning and the 'protection' element often gets compromised or neglected.</p>
                  
                  <p>If you’re like many of my clients, you may worry at different points in your life that you don’t have the right insurance, or enough insurance. Everyone has different insurance needs at different times. To determine if you might be missing something in your insurance portfolio, ask FOR A FREE EVALUATION OF YOUR INSURANCE PORTFOLIO.</p>
                  
                  <p>We’ve heard about life insurance before, but I’ll say it again: unless you can self-insure a projected worst-case scenario, life insurance can provide liquidity to avoid financial hardship.</p>
                  
                  <p>How does your insurance portfolio stand up to these questions? The “It won’t happen to me” mentality can be costly. Fires, floods, death, and disability happen.</p>
                  
                  <p>I’m not trying to send you into therapy, but you need to evaluate the worse-case scenario if people depend on you financially and you don’t have the resources to self-insure</p>
                  
                  <p>Sometimes, people call me after something has happened, but often by that time it’s too late, and they have dwindling options. I’m going to keep saying it until I stop getting those phone calls: you should get insurance when you don’t need it, because when you do need it, you can’t get it.</p>
                  
                  <b>MUTUAL FUNDS</b><br/><br/>
                  <b>Mutual Funds: The Key player of a Household's Investment Plan</b>
                  <br/>
                  <p>Why mutual funds are the best form of investment for households</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li>Being well-diversified financial instruments, they are less risky than if you were to invest in individual stocks. </li>
                      <li>You can reap investment opportunities from all over the world, as they are invested globally and into different financial instruments</li>
                      <li>They are managed by professional fund managers who aim to obtain higher returns for your money. You do not need to monitor equity markets closely for fluctuations. </li>
                  <li>There is a wide selection of mutual funds available to meet the different investment objectives of investors. Staying invested over time, these returns can compound to very attractive amounts, unlike savings deposits. </li>
                      <li>Fund houses are bound by agreement to purchase the mutual funds back from you should you decide to sell your holdings, at the prevailing price on the date of sale, regardless of the number of units sold. Liquidity gives flexibility</li>
                      <b>Inflation and investment</b><br/>
                      <p>A base fact of life is that expenses will mount: a situation that you will not be able to wish away. Your rupee must work harder for you in an era when your regular income lessens. While that is a difficult goal to achieve, there are some standard rules to which might help you lead towards it. Choosing the right asset to invest is a major rule. Historically return on stocks had always beaten inflation. There is no reason why it shouldn’t continue to do so in future. So if you would like counter inflation you need to choose a good diversified equity mutual fund</p>

                      <p>However one thing is certain: to tackle the inflationary trend, earnings must go up simultaneously. This, of course, is easier said than done. The other way to boost your earning is when your savings earn a lot. To make sure that your savings do this magic, they need to be converted into investments. The habit of investments therefore needs an early beginning and the right balance of assets.</p>
                      
                      <p>The portfolio is constantly reviewed and adjusted to variations in order to maximize returns and minimize risks. This means, fund managers buy or sell stocks or bonds as per the dictates of the fund and market pulls. For example an investment in a perceived risky instrument will be sold immediately and reinvested in a prospective media of the time.</p>
                      
                      <p>Building a portfolio of mutual funds is similar to building a house: There are many different kinds of strategies, designs, tools and building materials; but each structure shares some basic features.</p>
                      
                      <p>To build the best portfolio of mutual funds  we go beyond the sage advice, "Don’t put all your eggs in one basket:" A structure that can stand the test of time requires a smart design, a strong foundation and a simple combination of mutual funds that work well for your needs.</p>
